1. 'different batch for different tasks in Turn, I should rewrite sampler for DDP'

2. '512, as long as possible , actually according to GraphSAGE, sampling beneficial."

3. 'I think I still need to use "candidate items" for task 1 and 3'

4. 数字部分，tokenizer随机初始化,有道理

Because: (train)
     
    ground truth set of node_{1}: [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12], in which 10,11,12 is split into test data as target

     input:

     Node_{1234} is linked with {2,3,4,5,6,7} within 1 hop with corresponding edge feature: {...}. 
     What other node should be linked with node_{1} within 1 hop? 

200
1
14
     gt: {9}


     (inference)
    
    input: same as above

    output: 9  (groud truth set) 10,11,12

    I think I should not consider it is a good answer  (It is correct but not good)


     <node_1230>
     node_ 12 30
